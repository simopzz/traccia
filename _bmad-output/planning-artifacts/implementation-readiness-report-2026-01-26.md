## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

**READY**

The project artifacts are in excellent shape and fully prepared for implementation. The consistency between PRD, UX, Architecture, and Epics is exemplary.

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

None. No blocking issues were identified.

### Recommended Next Steps

1.  **Proceed to Phase 4 (Implementation):** The planning artifacts are solid enough to start coding immediately.
2.  **Monitor "Gotenberg" Setup:** Ensure Story 3.1 remains focused on the specific feature need and doesn't expand into unnecessary infrastructure complexity.
3.  **Validate "Taxi Card" Print Styles early:** Since this is a core value prop ("Survival Export"), test the PDF generation/print styles as soon as the basic rendering is working in Epic 3.

### Final Note

This assessment identified **0** critical issues across **5** categories. The project is well-positioned for a successful MVP build.
